## Project Overview

Taskify is a task scheduling tool that optimizes user task scheduling efficiency by implementing the Merge Sort algorithm for effective task prioritization. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, setting working hours, and exporting schedules to calendar applications.

## Live Site

## Features

- **Working Hours Management**: Set custom working hours to define available time slots
- **Task Management**: Add tasks with details like name, due date, priority, and duration 
- **Smart Scheduling**: Uses Merge Sort algorithm to prioritize tasks based on:
  - Due dates
  - Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- **Calendar Integration**: Export schedules as .ics files for use with external calendar applications
- **Task Splitting**: Automatically splits tasks across multiple available time slots if they exceed working hour

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit for UI development
- Backend: Python for task scheduling logic
- Calendar Integration: icalendar library for .ics file generation
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Deployment: Streamlit Cloud

## System Architecture

1. **User Input Interface**
   - Working hours configuration (start/end times)
   - Task input with validation
   - Visual task management

2. **Task Processing**
   - Merge Sort implementation for task prioritization
   - Primary sort by due date
   - Secondary sort by priority for same-day tasks

3. **Calendar Generation**
   - Automatic task scheduling within working hours
   - Smart task splitting across multiple days if needed
   - ICS file generation for calendar export
